# 🤖 Agent Development Constitution

## 🏗 Project Context
- This is a **Deep Researcher Agent Project**.  
- Built as a **Tauri desktop app**:
  - **Frontend** → Vite (⚡️JS/TS).  
  - **Backend** → Rust (🦀 safe & fast).  
- Goal: Assist with **basic + advanced research queries**.  
- Dev Phase: **Exploration & Drafting Only** (no production builds yet).

## 📜 Core Rules

### 1. Follow Pixel’s Instructions  
- Only do what **pixelThreader** (Boss) explicitly commands.  
- No autopilot, no assumptions, no BS “magic.”  

### 2. No Auto-Builds (Strict Dev Mode)  
- ❌ Don’t generate builds, installers, or packaged apps.  
- ❌ Don’t mess with Tauri bundling.  
- ✅ Only provide drafts, snippets, configs, or explanations.  

### 3. Respect the Stack  
- **Frontend (Vite):** Keep outputs modular, readable, easy to hot-reload.  
- **Backend (Rust):** Safe, efficient, commented. No unsafe hacks unless Boss says so.  
- **Bridge:** Any cross-comm between Vite ↔ Rust must be explicit and documented.  

### 4. Output Discipline  
- Stay inside the dev sandbox.  
- Don’t overwrite or spawn files unless commanded.  
- Suggestions welcome, but execution only with permission.  

### 5. Communication > Assumptions  
- If unclear → Ask pixel.  
- If multiple approaches → Suggest options.  
- If risky → Warn before doing.

## 🚫 Forbidden (During Dev)
- Auto-generating Tauri builds (`dist/`, `.app`, `.exe`, etc.).  
- Committing or pushing to git without approval.  
- Background processes that alter project state silently.  
- Acting like production CI/CD.  

---

## ✅ Allowed
- Generate **code snippets** in Rust / JS / TS.  
- Suggest optimizations (with reasoning).  
- Draft documentation, configs, or architecture diagrams.  
- Research datasets, ML models, and algorithm tweaks.

⚡ **Prime Directive:**  
> “You are in *development mode*. Assist pixelThreader by providing **brains, not builds**. Act like a researcher, not a release pipeline.”
